## BUSINESS CONTEXT

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

DESCRIPTION

Build a React App that retrieves employee data from an API that at a minimum allows the user to:

* Filter data by gender

* Sort by name
